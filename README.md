# MusicScales
Musical scales from around the world

Python code for Music Development

Keep your eye on this site. Within the next week I will be adding software
that will show scores for each of over 400 scales from around the world.
It creates sheet music of each scale in every key. The results can be output
as lilypond files, .png file or .pdf file.

This is a work in progress. Inital code was written several years ago while
I was learning python. You will be able to see improvement from module to
module as the learning moved forward.

The ultimate goal will be a system that is able to create exercises for music
instructors that can be used in class.

Supplemental functions will include:

manuscript printer capable of printing in as many formats as I know of.

chord charts for each of the scales in catalog.

User data entry which will allow experimentation with new scales starting with
or without an existing scale

midi output so that new scales can be tested without a keyboard

A Huge amount of Credit goes to  Francesco Balena, http://www.saxopedia.com
for his tremendous work on the publication 'The Scale Omnibus' which was my major
source for Interval patterns of scales from around the world.

There is a lot of code, and I will be submitting it piece meal so that I can fix
the most blatant style issues.

I will be looking for volunteers to help with ongoing development.
